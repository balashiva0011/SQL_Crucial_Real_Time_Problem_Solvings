üìù Question 3: 
"As a data analyst at a retail company, you are tasked with analyzing sales performance across different product categories. Your goal is to determine the total revenue generated by each category to help guide marketing and product development strategies."

Solution 3:(
select c.category_name, Sum(p.price*s.quantity) as total_revenue
from products p
join product_Categories c on p.category_id = c.category_id
join product_sales s on p.product_id = s.product_id
group by c.category_name

)


"This query calculates the total revenue generated for each product category.
- It selects the `category_name` from the `product_categories` table (`c`) and the total revenue (`SUM(p.price * s.quantity)`), which is the product of each product's price (`p.price`) and the quantity sold (`s.quantity`).
- It joins three tables: `products` (`p`), `product_categories` (`c`), and `product_sales` (`s`) using the relevant foreign key relationships (`category_id` and `product_id`).
- The `GROUP BY c.category_name` ensures the total revenue is calculated separately for each product category."
